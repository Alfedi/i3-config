* My i3 Config :)
** First of all
Most of the things that I have here are not of my own. Here I'll try to mention all the GitHub repos I clone to make this configuration files.
- I use i3-blocks so it's important to see the original -> https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks
- The modules I use came from this, but I edited them a little bit -> https://github.com/cytopia/i3blocks-modules
- And I use modules from here too -> https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib
- Spotify module -> https://github.com/firatakandere/i3blocks-spotify
